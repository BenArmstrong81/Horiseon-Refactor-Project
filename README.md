  ## What I Learned
  We focused on HTML & CSS this week. 
  
  With a focus on structures, styles and how we can adapt these styles to include; color, size font and positions of the elements. 

  We also bult upon our GitHub skills, ensuring we pushed and pull class work to stay upto date with the ever changing content.

  I also learnt that colaboration is key and to speak up and ask questions.

  ## What Problems Did we Solve?
  Fixed the broken link in the navigator bar.

  Refactored the CSS file and condensed a lot of the coding into 'groupings' (classes) instead of repeating the same code over and over.

  Refactored the HTML file to ensure a logical order was adheared to, ensured alt tags were on images, cleaned up some class elements to ensure it utilised the CSS file correclt and efficiently.`

  Created a clear and concise Readme file.
